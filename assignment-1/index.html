        <h2>Lyrics </h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            So you're on the prowl wondering whether</br>
            She left already or not</br>
            Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona</br>
            Never knowing when to stop</br>
            Sunglasses indoor is par for the course</br>
            Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls</br>
            Cages and poles
          </p>

          <p>
            Call off the search for your soul</br>
            Or put it on hold again</br>
            she's having a sly indoor smoke</br>
            And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends</br>
            Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes</br>
            As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach</br>
            And it seems as though those lumps in your throat</br>
            That you just swallowed have got you going</br>
          </p>

          <p>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            come on, come on, come on</br>
            Number one party anthem</br>
          </p>


          <p>
            She's a certified mind blower</br>
            Knowing full, well, that I don't</br>
            May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her</br>
            Just to get the ball to roll</br>
            Drunken monologues, confused because</br>
            It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya</br>
            To do me no good</br>
            And you look like you could</br>
          </p>

          <p>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Number one party anthem</br>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Before the moment's gone</br>
            Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah</br>
          </p>

          <p>
            The look of love, the rush of blood</br>
            The "She's with me" is the Gallic shrug</br>
            The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus</br>
            The black and white and the color dodge</br>
            The good time girls, the cubicles</br>
            The house of fun, the number one</br>
            Party anthem, oh</br>
          </p>

          <P>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Come on, come on, come on</br>
            Before the moment's gone</br>
            Number one party anthem</br>
          </P>

          <P>
            Number one party anthem</br>
            Number one party anthem</br>
            Yeah, yeah</br>
          </P>

        <h2>About the Song</h2>
        <p>
          “No. 1 Party Anthem” is a slow-burning, late-night track that captures
          the quiet confidence and emotional vulnerability hidden beneath the
          surface of nightlife bravado.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike the high-energy tracks on <em>AM</em>, this song leans into
          introspection, portraying a narrator caught between romantic hope and
          social self-awareness.
