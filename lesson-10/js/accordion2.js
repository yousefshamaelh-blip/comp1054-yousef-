// STEP 6: Nab all the details elements
const details = document.querySelectorAll("details")


// STEP 7: Loop through the element array, and add an event listener for the toggle event
details.forEach((detail) => {
	//console.log(detail);
	detail.addEventListener("toggle",(event) => {
		console.log("toggle!" + event);
		// STEP 8a: Check to see whether the DETAILS event that was toggled has the "open" attribute
		if (event.target.open) {
			// STEP 8b: The browser just added the "open" attribute, so this DETAILS element was previously closed
			details.forEach((detail) => {
				// STEP 8c: If this DETAILS element is NOT the one that was just clicked, close it by removing the "open" attribute
				if (detail !== event.target) {
					detail.removeAttribute("open")
				}
			
		
			});
		}
